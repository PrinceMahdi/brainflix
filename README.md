# BrainFlix Sprint-three

## What went well?

- This project was really fun to make. I enjoyed the progression in the difficulty and sprint-three definitely challenged me. By the end I finally got a good grasp of how to integrate back-end with front-end.

## What went wrong?

- Many of the diving deeper tasks were definitely challenging to implement. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to make everything work.

## What could be improved?

- I definitely need a lot more practice with back-end development. I need to spend time mastering the CRUD operations.

# BrainFlix Sprint-two

## What went well?

- The SCSS section went smoothly as I now have a very good grasp of various CSS properties that can accomplish tasks very well.
- Making Axios calls to the API was nice as well, especially with the new Async Await syntax

## What went wrong?

- I had an issue with an uncaught promise while pressing on the header logo but I fixed that with a ternary operator

## What could be improved?

- I used an extra axios call to handle the clicking of the videos, I'm sure that could be handled better.

# BrainFlix Sprint-one

## Diving Deeper Section

- I have implemented the Dynamic Date timestamp on the comments and the published date of the video.

## What went well?

- I enjoyed the making of this project as it challenged me to think of new ways of implementing a feature

## What went wrong?

- While implementing the click on the side videos feature, I encountered a bug where after clicking on any video it was taking me to the root div in the HTML file. I later realiezd that I wasn't retrieving the information I was passing to my onClick function correctly.

## What could be improved?

- The concept of React is still new to me so I think there are better ways of making components that are more efficient.
