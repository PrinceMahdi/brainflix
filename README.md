## Diving Deeper Section

- I have implemented the Dynamic Date timestamp on the comments and the published date of the video.

## What went well?

- I enjoyed the making of this project as it challenged me to think of new ways of implementing a feature

## What went wrong?

- While implementing the click on the side videos feature, I encountered a bug where after clicking on any video it was taking me to the root div in the HTML file. I later realiezd that I wasn't retrieving the information I was passing to my onClick function correctly.

## What could be improved?

- The concept of React is still new to me so I think there are better ways of making components that are more efficient.
